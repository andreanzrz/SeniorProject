	<h1>Test Data</h1>
	
	<h2><u>Invalid data used:</u></h2>
	<p>
		The invalid test data that I had used was to input a false password of the numbers "12" in the field 
		<em>$dbPassword</em> to try to connect to the database on the webpage named <em>Midwest.php</em>. 
		This was used to see if the database would produce a message saying that the database could not be reached. 
		The message worked and the database would not show on the webpage.<br>

	<h2><u>Valid data used:</u></h2>
	<p>
		The valid data that I had used to test on the website was the data that I had gathered for each of the regions
		and each of the states in those regions. I had gathered a state picture, state description, state flag, and 
		state flower for each of the 50 states in the U.S. Once I was done gathering the information, I input the data
		into the database that I had created on phpMyAdmin using MySQL and then tested the data to see if it would output 
		to the appropriate region webpage that was to be displayed. I had also tested region information by gathering 
		regional temperature information along with travel information. This data was much easier to test since all I had 
		to make sure was that the HTML code would input the information that I was typing into my Notepad++ editor.
